First, peapods have their own limitations.One limitation of Peapods is that it requires all user-mode executives must be recompiled by the modified LLVM we provide.This is conducive to the formation of a safe execution environment.It is difficult for an attacker to execute his own attack code, because it requires breaking the control flow integrity first.There are many effective control flow integrity protection implementation proposed, such as Cryptographic CFI, Forward Edge CFI, etc.Another limitation is that Peapods cannot protect libraries without source code.This problem could be solved when library developers apply Peapods to their closed-source libraries.


During the sensitive information calculation phase, Peapods relies on Intel TSX to ensure the confidentiality of protected sensitive information. However, cache(the foundation of TSX implementation) is limited by space and shared by all cores. This might lead to denial of service(DoS) attacks.Most of Intel's CPUs implement 8-way group-associated L1D caches, so 9 memory accesses to the same set of caches will inevitably result in transaction termination.Moreover, Intel does not guarantee that all L1D caches can be used in TSX.In addition, a memory-intensive process may also make it difficult for Peapods to complete a transaction.Due to the shared L3 cache, it is likely to evict the cache line that Peapods is using.Users can use T-SPLIT function to split the sensitive information calculation process, reducing the execution time and memory usage of a single transaction, which can effectively alleviate the impact of DoS attacks on Peapods.We completed the experiment to verify this result.

When the computer undergoes a core dump, as the Peapods transaction is interrupted, the master key, plaintext sensitive information, and intermediate calculations that have already been calculated are all cleared.Therefore, the attacker still cannot obtain sensitive information in plaintext.

Attackers may also attack sensitive information through the side channel.Fortunately, Peapods is immune to cache-based time-side channel attacks because AES-NI itself is not subject to any known side-channel attacks and the sensitive information calculation is fully implemented in the cache.Peepods can't resist timing side channel attacks, but programmers can defend against the attacks by refactoring the code and adding blinding algorithm.
