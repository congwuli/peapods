\section{CONCLUSION}
The cryptographic systems are now widely used and linked to the user's core interests.However,existing memory protections are difficult to support key security in user-mode cryptographic systems.This paper introduces Peapods, which is a automated, efficient compiler enhancement tool that provides security enhancements for application layer cryptographic systems that can defend against software memory attacks and cold-boot attack.
